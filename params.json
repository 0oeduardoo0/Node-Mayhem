We've used Melon.js, a bunch of Creative \r\nCommons-licensed art and coded our way to a quick, easy and fun shooter\r\nfor Node Knockout 2013. \r\n\r\nA short [video can be found on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17dk7ebUXf0)\r\n\r\n[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/LrfJbFm.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Using it\r\nThis version has been cleaned up and made open-source for people who'd\r\nlike to get a jumpstart on building a similar game. Feel free to use it to build\r\nyour own game, but please understand that we used art found online, so please\r\nrespect their individiual licenses.\r\n\r\n## Stuff used\r\n### Code\r\n - [Melon.js](http://melonjs.org)\r\n - [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)\r\n - [Socket.io](http://socket.io/)\r\n - [Express](http://expressjs.com/)\r\n - [Jade](http://jade-lang.com)\r\n\r\n### Art\r\n - [Liberated Pixel Cup](http://lpc.opengameart.org/)\r\n - [RPG Tiles](http://opengameart.org/content/rpg-tiles-cobble-stone-paths-town-objects)\r\n - [Prozi](http://opengameart.org/users/prozi)\r\n - Music (CC) by Wizwards, sound effects (CC) by timgormly\r\n\r\n## Developers\r\n - Helen Zeng (https://twitter.com/hwz)\r\n - Timothy Strimple (https://twitter.com/tstrimple)\r\n - Felix Rieseberg (http://www.felixrieseberg.com)\r\n\r\n## License\r\nUnless noted otherwise, the licensing of this package is governed by the license described below:\r\n\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\nCopyright (c) 2013 Helen Zeng, Timothy Strimple, Felix Rieseberg\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
